# ODE Animate

This project aims to be a set of tools for solving,
plotting, and animating _ordinary differential equations_,
solutions.

> The rational for this is, _trying to use pure-python_ to do
numerical analysis.

Most techniques here are going to be without the use of any
external modules.

The only external modules that are used _directly_ by this
project are:

 - `matplotlib`, which is used to configure the _figures_ for plotting.
 - `ffmpeg-python`, which is used to _gather_ several _figures_ and turn them in to
 animations.

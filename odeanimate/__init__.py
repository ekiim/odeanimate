# Introduction

This module aims to provide a set of tools do quickly and effectively produce visualization
useful users for by trying to mimic the language in which you define mathematical expresions,
while not putting aside the fact that the user is programing in python.

Good starting point could be reading the documentation for:

- [`vector`][odeanimate.vector]
- [`domains`][odeanimate.domains]
- [`curve`][odeanimate.curve]
- [`fields`][odeanimate.fields]

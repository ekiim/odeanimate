# Vector Objects

In mathematics vector has strictly speaking one meaining, an element of a vector space, but
in a more pragmatic look, we usually call a vector to an _arrow from one point to another in the
euclidean space_, and most of the geometry can be describe by analyzing the geometry
from the euclidean through undrestanding functions that map from it to a given object.

In this module we will deal with vectors in the most simple way possible, in an almost naive way.

A `Vector` is a programing object which is an instance of the `Vector` class, (there are also
sub classes for 2 and 3 dimensional vectors implementing the basics for them).

There is some to say about this objects, so I would recomend reading this document by following it
as if each method or class definition is a _lemma_.

        This method will create a two dimensional vector from a vector of dimension two.
        The difference is that you might have a vector which was generated as a vector
        with the base class, with out specifying "this is a two dimensional", and it will
        not be gifted with the methods here.
